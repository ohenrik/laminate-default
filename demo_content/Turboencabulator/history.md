# Turboencabulator

The turboencabulator or turbo-encabulator (and its later incarnation, the
retroencabulator or retro-encabulator) is a fictional machine whose alleged
existence became an in-joke and subject of professional humor among engineers.
The explanation of the supposed product makes extensive use of technobabble.

## History

The original technical description of the "turbo-encabulator" was written by
British graduate student John Hellins Quick (1923-1991). It was published in
1944 by the British Institution of Electrical Engineers Students' Quarterly
Journal in an article titled "The Turbo-Encabulator in Industry" by J.H. Quick,
Student <span class="fn">

noted by consulting firm Arthur D. Little in a 1995 reprint of Quick's
description, and giving Quick's full name. <span class="fn">

The earliest written U.S. source may have been in 1946, in an Arthur D. Little
Industrial Bulletin. An early popular American reference to the
turbo-encabulator appeared in an article by New York lawyer Bernard Salwen in
Time on April 15, 1946. Part of Salwen's job was to review technical
manuscripts. He was amused by the jargon and passed on the description from the
Arthur D. Little pamphlet. <span class="fn">A. B. Salwen, Bernard (15

Time got with the gag, featuring the device in a May 6, 1946 issue, described as
"An adjunct to the turbo-encabulator, employed whenever a barescent skor motion
is required." <span class="fn">"Letters, May 6, 1946". Time. May 6, 1946.
Retrieved March 8, 2011.</span> A month later a response to reader mail on the
feature appeared in the June 3, 1946 issue:

If the sackful of mail we have received from you is any indication, the story of
"The Turbo-Encabulator in Industry" struck many a responsive chord. Aside from
those of you who wanted to be reassured that TIME hadn't been taken in, we
received the customary complaints about using too much technical jargon for the
layman, observations such as "My husband says it sounds like a new motor; I say
it sounds like a dictionary that has been struck by lightning"; suggestions that
it "might have come out of the mouth of Danny Kaye," and plaintive queries like:
"Is this good?" Wrote one bemused U.S. Navyman: "It'sh poshible." To some the
turbo-encabulator sounded as though it would be a "wonderful machine for
changing baby's diapers." A reader from Hoboken assumed that it would be on sale
soon in Manhattan department stores. Many of you wrote in to thank us for
illuminating what you have long wanted to tell your scientist friends." <span

General Electric's Instrument Department, in West Lynn, Massachusetts. It quoted
from the previous sources and was inserted into the General Electric Handbook.
<span class="fn">Turboencabulator</span> The turboencabulator data sheet
had the same format as the other pages in the G.E. Handbook. The engineers added
"Shure Stat" in "Technical Features", which was peculiar only to the Instrument
Department, and included the first known graphic representation of a
"manufactured" Turboencabulator using parts made at the Instrument Department.

In c. 1977 Bud Haggart, an actor who appeared in many industrial training films
in and around Detroit, performed in the first film realization of the
description and operation of the "Turboencabulator", using a truncated script
adapted from Quick's article. Bud convinced director Dave Rondot and the film
crew to stay after the filming of an actual GMC Trucks project training film to
realize the Turboencabulator spot. <span class="fn">"Turbo Encabulator"

The technical descriptions of all these turboencabulators have remained
remarkably similar over the years.
